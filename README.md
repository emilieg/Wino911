**Wino911** helps you find a place that serves wine. Directions are provided to guide you to the closest destination so you can quench your thirst. If you like the place you can save it to your favorites list.
The local temperature display helps you decide whether you should drink red or white.  

# Technonlogy:
* *Node.js*, server
* *Express*, back-end app
* *PostgreSQL* & *Sequelize*, database set up
* *JavaScript*
* *bcrypt*, password encryption
* *express-session*, to remember a user between page loads

# General Approach:
I wanted to build a fun application utilizing google maps. As a wine lover and somebody that's always looking for a good wine bar I decided to build an app that would do just that. I started with the wireframes and user flow. I focused on keeping the app streamlined and consciously decided to implement only a few features. The app features oAuth and RESTful routing. A user is able to sign up, login, logout, save favorite bars to a favorites list that only she/he can access. 

# APIs:
* Google Places
* Google Directions
* Forecast.io


# Improvements:
* less Bootstrap & more CSS styling
* modify favorites list (add delete button & restyle)
* Goole Maps (add markers for more place options)
* add directions and routing only for places that user selects from the map
